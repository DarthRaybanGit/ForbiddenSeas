##Game Overview
###Game Summary
“Forbidden Seas” is a MOBA game in which you control a crew of seaman and battle against other vessels led by the other players,
 in order to obtain the greatest amount of treasures in the shortest possible time. It is inspired by the classic “Capture the flag”
 game mode, spreaded in many multiplayer online games, but in this case the phase in which the player have to protect the flag and 
 score a goal is emphasized. In “Forbidden Seas” when you catch the flag (symbolized by a treasure) you have to choose and navigate that channel 
 in the map, among all the others, that will transfer you to the port in the fastest way possible, as soon as the race phase begin.
###Platform
The target platform designed to play Forbidden Seas is the PC. It is chosen in order to use mouse's wheel like a slider to adjust 
the speed of the ship. We want to use this specific type of input in order to give to the player more challenge and to experiment a 
different gaming experience compared to most widespread and famous MOBA games.


This feature won’t exclude the possibility to design a similar input scheme for the gamepad. This would open the doors to the world 
of consoles, like PS4, XBOX One and also Nintendo Switch. But it would also bring other complications in terms of marketing stuffs.
